The aim of the project was to optimize a structure consisting of only bars and cables with different lengths and attributes. 
Using techniques from optimization-theory, we minimized the energy in the structure, leading to the most stable/optimal position of the structure.
One method used throughout the project was BFGS with strong wolfe linesearch.
Project grade: B
